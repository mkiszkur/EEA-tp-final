What are odds?

The odds of an event are the ratio of how likely the event is to occur to how likely it is to not occur. If
p(probability) tells use how likely an event is to occur then  
1 − p  tells us how likely it is not to occur and the odds are the ratio of these two,  
p
/
(
1
−
p
)
 . For example, suppose an event has a probability of  
75
%
 . The odds of that event are  
75
%
/
25
%
=
3
:
1
 , read as “3 to 1”. As another example, suppose you attend a meeting of 5 people, including yourself. You each write your name on a piece of paper for a randomly drawn door prize. Your chance, or probability, of winning the prize is 1/5 (0.20). Your odds of winning, however, are 1 to 4 (1:4) (0.25). There is one piece of paper with your name and four without, so you have one chance of winning and four chances to lose.

There is a one-to-one relationship between odds and probability. They are two ways of expressing the same thing, but on different scales. The odds are greater (less) than 1 if and only if the probability is greater (less) than 0.5, and the odds are exactly 1 if and only if the probability is 0.5.
